This demonstrates a skills bar component that could be used in a scenario you might seem fit.

Starting position is 'app.js' which will render 'skills.js'.
In skills.js, you will find the skills bar component which also has a dependency on another custom component called ProgressBar.js

As a bonus, there is a basic preconfigured code for Webpack - High five if you are happy.
